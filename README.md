This project explains how to scrape website data with Python using Jupitar Notebook.

I have divided code into mainly 7 parts.

1) Importing libraries

There are mainly 4 libraries used for this project. pandas, numpy, urllib and BeautifulSoup.

2) Creating a function to get data in HTML format from website.

Here, we are creating a function to reading the url and then extracting the HTML from the same with the help of html.parser.
